    \section{Feature Descriptions}
    \subsection{Rest-Server}

        It is possible to process an existing appointment via POST request. To do this, the appointment must be sent to the server as JSON.
        Furthermore, user name and token are to be handed over. If the transferred appointment exists and the username and token are valid,
        the appointment is changed on the server. The submitted appointment does not have to be a complete appointment object
        only the fields that you want to change need to be filled out. In this case, only the ID field of the appointment forms an exception because this is for searching
        of the appointment to be changed is used.
        If an error occurs, it will be returned as JSON to the POST request sender.

    \subsubsection{Delete appointment on Rest-Server}
        To use the feature, you must pass a username, token and the ID of the appointment to be deleted.
        On the server it is checked if there is an appointment for the given user and if the given token is valid.
        If this is the case, the appointment will be deleted.
        If an error occurs, it will be returned as JSON to the POST request sender.
    
    \subsubsection{Create group on Rest-Server}
        On the server, a group can be created by POST request.

        submitted the specified group.
        This information is used to check whether the user exists and the identity
        determined by token. It will then, if the checks were successful,
        created a group for the user. The owner of the group is the creator.
        In the event of an error or success, the appropriate response is sent to the POST request sender
        sent back as JSON.

        If the deletion fails, an error message is returned as JSON.


    \subsubsection{Get all groups of user}
        The server responds to a POST REQUEST. For the request, a username as well as a valid token must be transferred via JSON.

    \subsubsection{Get all appointments}
        To use this functionality, a POST request with username and token must be sent to the rest server.
        If the username and token are valid, all appointments will be sent back to the sender as JSON.
        In the event of an error, the error is returned to the sender as JSON.
    
    \subsubsection{Login user}

    \subsubsection{Logout user}
        In order to use this functionality of the remainder server, a JSON with username must be sent by POST request
        as well as tokens are sent. If token and username turn out to be valid
        the success as JSON sent back to the transmitter. Failure will result in an error message to the sender
        cleverly.
    \subsubsection{Check user}
